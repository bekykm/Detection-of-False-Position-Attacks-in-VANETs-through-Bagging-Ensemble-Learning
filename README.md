# Detection-of-False-Position-Attacks-in-VANETs-through-Bagging-Ensemble-Learning
This project focuses on detecting False Position Attacks in Vehicular Ad-hoc Networks (VANETs) using an innovative approach based on Bagging Ensemble Learning. False Position Attacks occur when malicious vehicles in a VANET falsify their position information, disrupting the network's integrity and security.

Using Bagging, a popular ensemble learning method, multiple models are trained to improve detection accuracy by reducing variance and increasing robustness against such attacks. This system effectively classifies network traffic and identifies fraudulent positioning with higher precision, ensuring secure communication within VANETs.

# Key Features:
* False Position Attack Detection: Focuses on identifying and mitigating False Position Attacks in VANETs.
* Ensemble Learning: Utilizes Bagging to combine multiple weak classifiers for enhanced model performance and stability.
* VANET Security: Contributes to improving the security of vehicular networks against malicious manipulation of position data.
* Model Evaluation: Includes performance metrics to evaluate the modelâ€™s efficiency in real-world VANET scenarios.
